Quick Settings tile for Android that forces audio output to speaker when connected to Bluetooth devices.

## üì± The Problem

When you connect a Bluetooth sound source, Android automatically routes all audio through them. If you want to quickly play something through your phone's speaker without disconnecting Bluetooth, there's no built-in way to do it.

## ‚ú® The Solution

AudioToggle adds a Quick Settings tile that lets you override Bluetooth audio routing with a single tap, forcing audio to play through your phone's speaker while keeping Bluetooth connected.

## üéØ Use Cases

- Show a video to a friend without disconnecting your headphones
- Play a quick sound on speaker while Bluetooth is connected
- Switch between speaker and Bluetooth without diving into settings

## üì• Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/szymonbonkowski/AudioToggle/releases)
2. Install on your Android device
3. Open the app and grant permissions:
   - Disable battery optimization
   - Allow background activity
4. Add the "Audio Output" tile to Quick Settings
5. Tap the tile to toggle audio output

## üìã Requirements

- **Android 9.0 (Pie) or higher**

## üîß How It Works

The app uses Android's audio focus system with a foreground service that maintains speaker routing. When active, it holds audio focus with `USAGE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION` attributes, which forces Android to route audio through the speaker instead of connected Bluetooth devices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

Since Android doesn't natively support manual audio output switching, this app uses a workaround by activating speakerphone mode:

- **Volume control**: Hardware volume buttons may not respond. Use the on-screen volume slider
- **Rapid toggling**: Quickly tapping the tile multiple times may cause Bluetooth to disconnect temporarily
- **Device compatibility**: Behavior may vary across manufacturers and Android versions

These are inherent limitations of the workaround approach. Contributions to improve this are welcome!
